# SyncIn

Sync into opportunities using SyncIn: an iOS and Angular web app that connects event go-ers with recruiters just by being in proximity. No more waiting in line to talk to recruiters, or scratching their numbers down. Just by being close to an iBeacon setup, your phone can receive live information on the recruiter's event and contact informations.
